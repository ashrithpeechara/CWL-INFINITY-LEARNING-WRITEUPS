<h1 align="center">🔍 CWL Infinity Learning Lab Repository</h1>

<p align="center">
A structured and evolving archive of my offensive and defensive security learning journey through the <strong>CWL Cybersecurity Lab Framework</strong>.
</p>

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on work across CWL’s five major cybersecurity domains — exploring both **Offensive** and **Defensive** approaches.  
Each lab entry includes:

- Methodologies  
- Findings  
- Commands & tooling  
- Screenshots (where applicable)  
- Reflections and learning outcomes  

This is not just a study repo — it’s a growing **DFIR + Cyber Operations portfolio**.
