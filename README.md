#  About This CWL Labs Repository

I have started working through the CWL Cybersecurity Lab Framework, which is built across **five major security domains**, each explored through both **Offensive** and **Defensive** lenses.  
This repository serves as a structured archive of my lab walkthroughs, technical findings, screenshots, methodologies, and reflections across all domains.
